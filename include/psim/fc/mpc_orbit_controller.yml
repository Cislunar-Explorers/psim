    Interface for the MPC orbit controller (which is ultimately implemented in
    Python using CVXPY) to plugin to the simulation. This model must be run at
    the start of a step to transform the commanded Delta-V from the HILL frame
    to ECEF.

args:
    - satellite

params:
    - name: "truth.{satellite}.m"
      type: Real

    - name: "fc.{satellite}.orbit.J.hill"
      type: Writable Vector3
