**Tracker Component Library Release 4.0, January 2019**
https://github.com/USNavalResearchLaboratory/TrackerComponentLibrary

A paper describing a number of features of the library is<br>
D. F. Crouse, "The Tracker Component Library: Free Routines for Rapid
Prototyping," IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine, vol. 32, no.
5, pp. 18-27, May. 2017.

These are the release notes for the version 4.0 of the Tracker Component
Library. The Tracker Component Library is a collection of Matlab routines
for simulating and tracking targets in various scenarios. Due to the
complexity of the target tracking problem, a great many routines can find
use in other areas including combinatorics, astronomy, and statistics.

Making this code available and open source is in the spirit of OMB M-16-21,
which can be viewed online at:
https://sourcecode.cio.gov/

Those looking for magnetic field synthesis code might want to look at
./Sample Code/Magnetic Models/ .

As of version 3.0, the library has been split into two parts. This is the
publicly available part. A number of functions have been placed into a
supplement that is only available to the U.S. Government Agencies and their
contractors.The limited distribution supplement can be downloaded by
authorized individuals from di2e.net at:
https://bitbucket.di2e.net/projects/TCL

Those looking to get a quick idea of a very simple end-to-end tracking
algorithm (track initiation, data association, maintenance, and
termination) might want to look at
./Sample Code/Basic Tracking Examples/demo2DIntegratedDataAssociation.m
to see an example of a complete GNN-JIPDAF tracker run on a simple 2D
tracking scenario, which can be easily transformed into a normal JIPDAF
by changing a single parameter. The tracker is made from the modular
components of the library. A lot of other sample code is also provided to
demonstrate the use of other parts of the library.

To use the full library, add the library and all of its subfolders to your
active path in Matlab. Some functions are available as C/C++ files for use
in Matlab either because they use third-party libraries (and must be
compiled to be used) or because the native Matlab implementations provided
are too slow in certain circumstances. These files can be compiled by
running the CompileCLibraries function. Precompiled code is not distributed
with the library. Note that a C/C++ compiler supported by Matlab must be
installed. See below for comments regarding compilation.

NOTABLE CHANGES SINCE VERSION 3.5

- Routines related to stochastic calculus have been changed and new ones
  have been added. They are in:
  Mathematical Functions/Statistics/Stochastic Processes/
- New continuous-time state propagation models based on Itô-Taylor
  expansions have been added to:
  Dynamic Estimation/State Propagation/Continuous Time/
- All continuous-time dynamic models in the library have been updated to
  work with these (and bugs fixed) and some new dynamic models have been
  added.
- Functions splitting the measurement prediction and update steps for most
  filters have been added. This makes hypothesis generation faster,
  particularly with cubature filters.
- Functions related to robust estimation have been added to:
  Mathematical Functions/Statistics/Robust Statistics/
  One can, for example, fit lines to data corrupted with arbitrary bad
  measurements.
- Added many more combinatoric functions and updated existing ones. See
  Mathematical Functions/Combinatorics/
- Joint matrix diagonalization algorithms (useful for independent component
  analysis) have  been added. See
  Mathematical Functions/Basic Matrix Operations/Joint Matrix Diagonalization/
- Misc. statistical functions. For example, unbiased estimates of higher-
  order moments and cumulants are difficult to derive, but can be found
  using the unbiasedMomentCumulant function.

NOTABLE CHANGES SINCE VERSION 3.01

- More compiled versions of 2D and 3D assignment code are available and the
  C implementations have been more modularized to make then simpler to
  remove from the Matlab parts of the library and use elsewhere.
- Sped up the dense interior point linear programming method by a large
  factor compared to the textbook implementation.
- A few new optimization methods.
- Improved the probability distributions. Added new ones, such as the
  wrapped normal distribution, and added entropy to many of them.
- For the many functions that have no Matlab implementation and must be
  compiled to be used (mostly those using third-party libraries), shell .m
  files have been added to the library, so that one can type "help" and the
  name of the function to get information on how to use it. Also, if the
  function is called without having compiled it, then an error alerts the
  user to the need to compiled the function.
- Bug fixes and small changes.
- Updated third-party code. Removed reliance on third-party functions for
  line searches.

NOTABLE CHANGES SINCE VERSION 3.0

- Minor corrections.
- Minor modifications to files to support the final release of the limited
  distribution supplement to the library.
- New 2D and 3D assignment algorithms, among other additions.

NOTABLE CHANGES SINCE VERSION 2.5

- Many new functions have been added.
- Many corrections have been made and a number of functions in different
  areas have been added or made more versatile/ stable.
- A number of routines related to signal processing have been added to the
  library in the Mathematical Functions/Signal Processing folder.
- Less reliance on third-party libraries and compiled code. NASA's SPICE
  library has been removed and the function readJPLEphem can be used to
  read in NASA JPL's ephemerides without compiling anything. Additionally,
  the directGeodeticProb function has been rewritten in Matlab and does not
  use GeographicLib, though the GeographicLib library is still used to
  solve the indirect geodetic problem.
- Spherical harmonic synthesis has been simplified and now works with
  vector coefficients and complex coefficients. Additionally, in addition
  to obtaining a potential and a gradient, one can obtain a Hessian matrix,
  opening the door to simulation of gravity gradiometer measurements.
  Fitting of low to moderate order spherical harmonic coefficients to
  measured data is now possible with the fitSpherHarmonics function.
- Arbitrary-order multivariate B-spline fitting, evaluation,
  differentiation, and integration has been added. 
- Linear dynamic models expressed in non-Cartesian coordinate systems have
  been added along with conversions of states between coordinate systems.
  See /Dynamic Models/Continuous Time/Non-Cartesian Position/ and
  /Coordinate Systems/State Coordinate System Conversion/

COMPILED CODE:

The compilation of the library has been tested under Matlab2018b for Mac OS
X 10.12 using the Matlab-supported compiler offered free by Apple. Under
Linux, gcc was used as the compiler. The code should also compile under
Windows 10 using minGW. Precompiled code is not distributed with the
library.

EXTERNAL SOLVERS:

Almost all of the function in the library work without any external
resources. However, the folder
./Mathematical Functions/Polynomials/Generic Multivariate Polynomials/
contains the function solvePolySysWithExtProg. This is an interface to
external solvers for simultaneous multivariate polynomial systems. The
solvers are external programs and are not included. Though the functions
polyRootsMultiDim and solveQuadBivarEq can solver certain types of
simultaneous multivariate polynomials, they are limited. For more general
systems, an external solver is the best choice. The functions
polyMeasConvert, polyMeasConvertAsync, and DopplerOnlyInit6D are located in
subfolders entitled 'Uses External Solver" and use the function
solvePolySysWithExtProg. Supported external solvers for the function
solvePolySysWithExtProg are PHCpack, Bertini, and the certified solver in
Macaulay2. Note that Macaulay2 tends to fail more often than the other
solvers.

The solvers can be downloaded from:
PHCpack for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux:
http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~jan/download.html
Bertini (version 1.5) for Mac OS X and Linux and Windows, only with Cygwin:
https://bertini.nd.edu/download.html
Macaulay2 for Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows:
http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/

For the external solvers to work, they need to be added to the search path
used in Matlab so that the phs/bertini/m2 commands can be called using the
system command in Matlab.

DATA SOURCES:

If the library was downloaded without associated data files for solar
system ephemerides as well as magnetic, gravitational and terrain models,
then the relevant data files will have to be downloaded The original 
sources of the data are:

1) Earth2014 terrain model:
https://geodesy.curtin.edu.au/research/harmonic/
The files Earth2014.BED2014.degree2160.bshc,
Earth2014.ICE2014.degree2160.bshc, Earth2014.RET2014.degree2160.bshc,
Earth2014.SUR2014.degree2160.bshc, Earth2014.TBI2014.degree2160.bshc should
be placed into ./Terrain/data . Though data files to degree and order
10,800 are also available, they are not currently supported as the function
spherHarmonicEval does not use extended precision arithmetic, which is
required to avoid overflows when using the model.

2) EGM2008 terrain model (The DTM2006.0 model):
http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm2008/first_release.html
The file Coeff_Height_and_Depth_to2190_DTM2006.0 should be placed into 
./Terrain/data . The first time using the getEGM2008TerrainCoeffs function
will be significantly slower than subsequent calls, assuming the full model
is loaded the first time.

3) The EMM2017 magnetic field coefficients:
https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/EMM/
The coefficients are included with the software that is provided. The files
having names like EMM2015.COF and EMM2000.COF should all be zipped into an
archive with the name EMM_Coefficients.zip and placed in ./Magnetism/data .
The files with names like EMM2015SV.COF andEMM2000SV.COF should all be
zipped into an archive with the name EMM_Secular_Variations.zip and placed
into ./Magnetism/data . If all of the data for a single year is loaded,
then a .mat file containing the data is placed in  the data folder to speed
up subsequent calls to the function.

4) The IGRF12 magnetic field coefficients:
http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf.html
The file http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf12coeffs.txt can be
downloaded and placed into the folder ./Magnetism/data .

Free Spherical Harmonic Coefficients". Decompress the file and place it in
./Gravity/data .

7) EGM96 gravitational coefficients
http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm96/egm96.html
The file egm96.z should be downloaded and decompressed, resulting in a file
names egm96 without an extension, which should be placed in
./Gravity/data .

8) EGM2008 parameters needed to convert height anomalies to geoid
   undulations:
http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm2008/egm08_wgs84.html
The "Correction Model" file Zeta-to-N_to2160_egm2008.gz should be
downloaded, ungzipped and placed in ./Gravity/data .

9) EGM96 parameters needed to convert height anomalies to geoid
   undulations:
http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm96/egm96.html
The file corrcoef.z should be decompressed and placed in ./Gravity/data .

10) NASA JPL's DE430t planetary/solar/lunar ephemerides
ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/Linux/de430t
The file linux_p1550p2650.430t should be downloaded and placed in 
./Astronomical Code/data
for use by the readJPLEphem function. The readJPLEphem function can read
other NASA ephemerides, but the DE430t set are the default.
