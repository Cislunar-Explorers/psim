function J=uGradient2D(x,lRx,M)
%%UGRADIENT2D Determine the gradient of a direction cosine measurement in
%          2D with respect to 2D position. Relativity and atmospheric
%          effects are not taken into account.
%
%INPUTS: x The 2XN set of target position vectors in the global coordinate
%          system with [x;y] components for which a gradient is desired.
%      lRx The 2X1 position vector of the receiver. If omitted, the
%          receiver is placed at the origin.
%        M A 2X2 rotation matrix from the global Coordinate system to the
%          orientation of the coordinate system at the receiver. If
%          omitted, it is assumed to be the identity matrix.
%
%OUTPUTS: J A 1X2XN set of N Jacobian matrices where the row represents u
%           and the columns take the derivative of the rows component with
%           respect to [x,y] in that order.
%
%A derivation of the components of the Jacobian of a 3D u-v measurement is
%given in [1]. The results here are similar.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we validate the results using numerical differentiation.
% x=[1000;4];
% lRx=[-40;2];
% M=eye(2,2);
% J=uGradient2D(x,lRx,M)
% f=@(x)Cart2Ru2D(x,[],[],lRx,M);
% N=3;
% epsVal=[1;0.01];
% numJAug=numDiff(x,f,2,N,epsVal);
% JNumDiff=numJAug(2,:)
%One will see that J and JNumDiff are essentially the same.
