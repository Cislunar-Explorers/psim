function J=TDOAGradient(x,lRx1,lRx2,c)
%%TDOAGRADIENT Determine the gradient of a time-delay of arrival (TDOA)
%           measurement in 1D, 2D, or 3D space with respect to position
%           (gradient components for velocity etc. are zero and are not
%           provided). Atmospheric and other propagation effects are not
%           taken into account.
%
%INPUTS: x The numPosDimX1 target position vector of the form [x], [x;y] or
%          [x;y;z].
% lRx1,lRx2 The numPosDimX1 locations of the receivers. This assumes that
%          the TDOA measurement is taken using the time received at lRx1
%          as the reference time. Thus, the TDOA is the time at lRx1 minus
%          the time at lRx2. If either of these are omitted or an empty
%          matrix is passed, then the receiver is placed at the origin.
%          These cannot be both placed in the same spot.
%        c The propagation speed in the medium in question. If this
%          parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, the default
%          value of Constants.speedOfLight is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: J A 1XnumPosDim gradient of the TDOA with derivatives taken with
%           respect to components [x,y,z] in 3D, [x,y] in 2D or [x] in 1D,
%           in thatorder.
%
%A TDOA measurement is of the form (norm(x-lRx1)-norm(x-lRx2))*(1/c). The
%gradient is straightforward to find from there.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we validate that the gradient is consistent with the value obtained
%by numerical differentiation.
% lRx1=[-3;0];
% lRx2=[3;0];
% c=1;
% xTrue=[4;4];
% h=@(x)getTDOA(x,lRx1,lRx2,c);
% grad=TDOAGradient(xTrue,lRx1,lRx2,c);
% gradNumDiff=numDiff(xTrue,h,1);
% relErr=(grad-gradNumDiff)./abs(grad)
%One will see that the relative error is better than 1e-10 in each
%component, indicating what that results are consistent.
