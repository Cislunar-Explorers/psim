The archive for the Matlab version of SCS has been added to this archive
for the C version. The archive for the C version is in the 
scs-matlab-master folder. The Matlab version is from
https://github.com/bodono/scs-matlab
and the C version is from 
https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs

Files that are not used have been compressed into "Unused Code.zip"
archives.

In order to keep all code with licenses containing copyleft provisions or
that force modifications to be published out of the Tracker Component
Library, the files related to the compiled version of the "direct" version
of the splitting conic solver have put into the "unused Code" archives. The
compile script make_scs.m was modified to be consistent with the removal of
this code. Additionally, the GPU code was put into an unused code archive
as it is not used.

As the direct algorithm is no longer available in a compiled version, the
Matlab implementation of the direct algorithm in the examples folder is
used instead. The file scs_matlab was modified so that it uses the
params.verbose option that is available in the compiled version and it
only displays outputs if verbose is true.
